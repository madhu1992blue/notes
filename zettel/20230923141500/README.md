# Running .go programs

Let's assume that we have a hello-world.go file.

## Run without compiling

```bash
go run hello-world.go
```

## Compile and run a ".go" program

### Compile
```
go build hello-world.go
```
This compiles the program and generates a binary,`hello-world`, in the current working directory

### Running the created binary
`./hello-world`
