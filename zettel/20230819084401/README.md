# Sample Zettel Structure

Every Zettel is a named directory:
* Directory name : timestamp in format yyyymmddhhmmss
* Contents: README.md (entrypoint) and associated resources.

Content can reference other zettels . Let me reference a non-existing zettel: Z19911111111111 (I wasn't born to create this Zettel based on my convention)
Unordererd list:
* Use Unordered List when order doesn't matter
* Begin line with an asterisk/hyphen

Ordered List:
1. Use this when order matters
1. Notice that I begin second line with 1 again. Markdown takes care of rendering right numbers. Use this and avoid explicit numbering.

Use *italic*, **bold** or ***bold italic*** only. Avoid Underscores.

Don't hide links like [hidden-link](https://github.com/madhu1992blue)  
Show the links as : https://github.com/madhu1992blue (Imagine if you would like to print the doc, visible links carry info)
